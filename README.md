# House-Price-Prediction-System
Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.
Implemented Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to compare model performance.
Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning for accuracy improvement.
Visualized insights using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to interpret price trends.
Deployed the model using Flask/Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
